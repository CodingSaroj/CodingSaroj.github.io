<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
    Hi, I am Saroj Kumar and I live in India. I am currently 15 years old and I am
    studying in 10th standard. I like maths, physics and computer science. Currently, I do programming as
    a hobby. I use C++ as my main programming language because I mainly work on native applications although
    I do web-development as well. I like to understand things from the roots which is the main reason I use
    C++.
